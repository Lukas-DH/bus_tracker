# Real-Time bus tracker

## Description

This project uses mapbox.com api for the map visualisation, the MBTA V3 api using the JSON API format, and the JavaScript languages async functions, Async and Await. Bus positions are updated live every 5 seconds!  

Take a look at the demo on my portfolio page [here](https://lukas-dh.github.io/03_bus_tracker/index.html).

## Installation

You can run this application in your broswer by simply downloading the files in one folder and opening the index.html  
NOTE: you must use your own mapboc token for the app to work. You can get it at [mapbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com/).

## Future improvements

I plan to include some of my local transport lines here in Paris, France.
